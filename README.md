# Fit Finance Figures

## Project Overview

The goal of Fit Finance Figures is to gain insights into the pricing, product distribution, and discounts offered by popular fitness apparel brands.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 3.x
- MySQL 8.0.36
- Python libraries: requests, BeautifulSoup, csv

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: ``git clone https://github.com/seanjyi8424/fit-finance-figures.git``
2. Install the required Python libraries: ``pip install requests beautifulsoup4``
3. Set up the MySQL database:
- Create a new database named `fitness_apparel`.

## Data Collection

The data collection process involves web scraping the fitness apparel websites using a Python script. The script, `nike_scraper.py`, extracts product information from the Nike website such as name, price, and discount from the websites.

To run the web scraping script: ``python nike_scraper.py``

The scraped data will be exported as CSV files in the `data` directory.

## Data Export and Import

After running the web scraping script, the collected data will be exported as CSV files in the `data` directory. To import the CSV files into the MySQL database:

1. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your database.
2. Create the necessary tables using the SQL scripts provided in the `sql` directory.
3. Import the CSV files into the corresponding tables using Table Data Import Wizard in MySQL Workbench.

## Database Schema

The database schema consists of the following tables:
- `nike_products`: Contains information about Nike products.
- `puma_products`: Contains information about Puma products.
- ...

## SQL Analysis

The SQL queries for analyzing the data are located in the `sql` directory. Each SQL file focuses on a specific analysis task:

- `analyze_price_points.sql`: Analyzes the price points of Nike and Puma products.
- `analyze_discounts.sql`: Analyzes the discounts offered by each brand.
- ...

To execute the SQL queries, open the desired SQL file in MySQL Workbench and run the queries.

## Results and Findings

The analysis of the fitness apparel data revealed the following insights:

EXAMPLES FOR NOW
- Nike products have a higher average price point compared to Puma.
- Puma offers more frequent discounts compared to Nike.
- ...

Detailed findings and visualizations can be found in the `reports` directory.

## Folder Structure

- `data`: Contains the CSV files exported from the web scraping process.
- `sql`: Contains the SQL scripts for creating tables and analyzing the data.
- `reports`: Contains the markdown files with detailed findings and visualizations.
- `scripts`: Contains Python scripts for web scraping the fitness apparel websites.
